# Theoretical-Neuroscience

### Python solutions to the exercise problems in the textbook Theoretical Neuroscience: Computational and Mathematical Modeling of Neural Systems by Peter Dayan and L.F. Abbott.

I will be trying to upload as many solutions as possible. The python codes I have used is basic throughout first chapter.

*There can be mistakes in the solutions that I upload. One of the main reason I' m uploading is to get feedback. Feel free to point out the mistakes or to suggest better approaches.*
